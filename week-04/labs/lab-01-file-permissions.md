# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Chantel Mallory

**Date Completed:** 8/11/26

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B use **bash**; Part C uses **PowerShell** |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and find the **"Foundry District Badge Office"** scenario. You'll see two entries in the list: **Badge Office — Bash** (used for Parts A and B) and **Badge Office — PowerShell** (used for Part C). Start with the Bash one. It seeds a small folder of files whose permissions have… issues. That's the point.

---

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

Run the long listing (`ls -l`) in your starting folder. This is the same listing from Week 3's `ls`, with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
ls-1
```

Output (the full listing):

```
Mode      Name

-a ----   badge-codes.txt

-a ----   cleanup.sh

-a ----   master-inventory.txt

-a ----   shift-notes.txt

-a ----   supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
cleanup.sh
Access: -rw-r -- r --
```

Your plain-English decode:

```
Owner: Read and Right
Group: Read only
Other: Read only
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
151 master-inventory.txt

Everyone has the permissions to read and write the master inventory file
```

---

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator's checklist will verify this — a change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

The problem file from Part A, Step 3 should not be writable by the group or by other. Fix it: revoke write from group (`g-w`), then revoke both read and write from other. Run `ls -l` before your first change and after your last one.

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
(I did it in two parts)

ls -l
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
ls -l

chmod o-w master-inventory.txt
ls-l
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
OLD: rw-rw-rw
NEW: rw-r-rw

OLD: rw-r-rw
New: rw-r-r
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

The scenario seeds a script (its name ends in `.sh`) that its owner cannot currently execute. Grant the owner execute — and only the owner. Verify with `ls -l` after.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rwxr--r--

Owner: Everything
Group: Read
Other: Nothing
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

There's a file whose name makes clear it shouldn't be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read. Verify.

Commands you ran:

```
chmod o-r master-inventory.txt
ls -l
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r-----
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

**Read this first — it will save you some confusion.** Every challenge in the CLI Simulator hands you a **fresh copy** of the Badge Office folder. That's deliberate: each challenge is its own clean exercise. You'll see `(fresh filesystem for this challenge)` on the divider line each time. It also means your fixes from earlier challenges will *not* still be showing when you reach the last one. Nothing you did was undone, and nothing you did was wrong — the folder was simply reset.

So build your evidence listing **inside the last challenge**. Apply all three fixes there, one after another, then run one final `ls -l`:

```
chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
chmod u+x cleanup.sh
chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
ls -l
```

That one listing shows all three fixes together — that's your evidence. Take a screenshot of your simulator session showing it. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-permissions-audit.png`. You'll upload and embed it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

Switch to the PowerShell side of the scenario and run `Get-Acl` on the seeded file the scenario panel points you to. Windows shows a *list* of named accounts and rights instead of three ring-triplets.

Command you ran:

```
Get-Acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the owner line and at least one access entry):

```
Path : shift-notes.txt
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r -- r --
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take one access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
Access : -rw-r -- r --
Owner: Read and write only
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The other is usually the most important to check on a shared system because with it being a public computer there are a variety of users accessing. This means that at any time someone with less than good intentions can access/edit or execute a file or application that they are not suppose to. This can raise security concerns and leave many chances for vulnerabilities to be exploited.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The before check confirms what permissions are already in place this is important because you want to make sure you ensure you do not make a mistake a change the permissions of one file thinking you are working on another or change a permission that does not need changing. The check after confirms that you made the change you intended to make and that it went through.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Everyone had read and write access. This can be problematic because unauthorized access warrants unauthorized changes which can cause bigger problems some which may be irreversible or have significant damage. Least privilege helps to stop this by giving everyone only the access they need first, adding additional when needed and being sure to remove when no longer needed. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The Windows permission version can be more helpful in this instance for giving someone specific access. It also gives you the flexibility to overlap and give someone double access for instance having someone have the same access as the owner to read write and execute and then also having them in the group with read write privilege.  
```
